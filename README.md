## :world_map: Finding Your Way

This repository contains three primary resources:

- Our current [on-demand courses](https://services.github.com/on-demand/) can be found in the [paths directory](/paths)
- The translations of our popular [Git Cheat Sheets](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) can be found in the [downloads directory](/downloads). We're always looking for more. _P.S._ Right now the PDF generation is a manual process so please mention @github/services-training for assistance in getting your translation moved to the PDF.
- The recommended Training Path can be found [here](https://services.github.com/resources/learning-path/).

## Our Content Philosophy

We are eager to create materials that are easy to use and follow! To that end, here are a few guidelines we ask you to keep in mind:

- We focus on providing clear, step-by-step instructions for completing an activity, giving the learner the opportunity to study the concept in greater detail with the Tell Me Why feature.
- We focus on minimalism.

## Projects Used in Training-Kit
- We use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
- The theme for the on-demand training is [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and has some [amazing documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).
- The corner badge of an Octocat is from [tholman.com](http://tholman.com/github-corners/)

## Building and Packaging

#### Building and Testing Locally

When you are ready to test your changes, you will want to build the repository locally. This is fully automated through a series of shell scripts based on [the scripts to rule them all](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all)!

To perform a build of the materials perform the following:

1. Run `script/setup`
1. Run `script/server`.
    - When successful, the script will initiate a local server at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/on-demand/`.
1. Simply paste that into your favorite web-browser and you will be ready to test.
1. You'll also need to run the following script to compile the SCSS (you can remove the `watch` flag if desired):
```
sass --watch assets/_scss/main.scss:assets/css/main.css
```

#### Packaging for Viewing Behind Your Firewall

If you'd like to have a copy of the files to be served from a web server inside of your firewall, start by running `script/package`.

1. Run `script/package` to create a release tarball. This will be in the format `release-XXXXXXX.tgz` for you to take wherever you want.
2. To test this looks okay, create some folders `mkdir -p test_site/kit`.
3. Untar the release, `tar -xzf release-XXXXXXX.tgz -C test_site/kit`.
4. Switch into the test_site directory, `cd test_site`.
5. View the site with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. _Note: Some servers are obviously more advanced than others and can handle redirects, smart recognition of `.html` files, etc_
